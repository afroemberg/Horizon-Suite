# Localisation Keys
## [Official WoW Locales](blizzardlocales.md)
Do not edit anything within the `localisation/blizzard` folder except to update the entirety of its contents.
## [Horizon Suite](localisation/horizon/)
Strings may only be added to **`enUS.lua`** as the other locales are regenerated from it.
Do not edit anything within the `localisation/horizon` folder except to add strings.

Every key shares the same format. It is **crucial** that the coding syntax remains the same.
```
L["DEFINED_TERM"]                                                = "Translated into the respective language, English by default."
```
A template key is provided for you at the top of the `enUS.lua` file, as seen below.
```
L["TERM"]                                                = " "
```
### Please mention in the commit and PR message if  `node tools/restructure_locales.js` was run.

## Key Nomenclature
Each key follows the same format.
`DEFINED_TERM` is `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
New strings follow the `King's English` (UK English), such as `organise`, `colour`, and `centre`, etc.

The primary concern with naming keys is their potential **ambiguity**.

Keep them simple and demonstrate their *intent*, as opposed to the *content* of the translation.
Ideally, reference the official key. If its meaning is self-evident or names a concrete thing within WoW, leave it as is.

Use prefixes if, *and only if*, ambiguity is a concern.

# !!! See Below for a TEMPORARY Naming Scheme !!!
Confirm before each addition that the naming scheme has not changed.
This file will be edited to match the final scheme once it is determined.
